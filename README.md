## Overview of PyCity Schools Analysis
The PyCity Schools analysis was originally completed to get a complete picture of the performance of schools within the school district. An issue arose where 9th grade students were found to have participated in academic dishonesty in some capacity. The school district requested that we re-complete the school district analysis but this time we exempt all 9th grade students from Thomas High School. This required re-factoring much of the code that was previously used and also allowed for the improvement of sevral lines of code. 
## Results of Analysis
The results of the analysis revealed that omitting the ninth-graders of Thomas High School affected several different measurements in minor ways. Overall, it can be seen in the charts that omitting ninth graders from Thomas High School lowered their overall test results dropping their overall passing percentage by roughly 0.3%. However, this was not enough to impact their overall rating among other schools in the school district. The results of these analysis can be seen in the following sections.
